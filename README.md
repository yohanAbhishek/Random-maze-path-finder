I have implemented and compared the performance of both depth-first search and A* search algorithms in traversing a 6x6 randomly generated maze. The objective of this project was to demonstrate the efficiency of the A* algorithm as an informed search algorithm. By utilizing the heuristic function, the A* algorithm was able to efficiently navigate through the maze and find the optimal solution, outperforming the depth-first search algorithm which relied solely on depth-based exploration. The results of this project provide evidence of the effectiveness of the A* algorithm in solving pathfinding problems and its potential applications in various fields such as robotics and game development.
